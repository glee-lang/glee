# glee 🎨✨

**Modern. Expressive. Pragmatic.**

glee is a modern programming language designed to blend the simplicity of high-performance systems languages with the flexibility of scripting environments. It focuses on developer productivity, extensibility, and crystal-clear code.

## 🌟 Philosophy

glee was built for developers who want to build powerful software without the "tax" of unnecessary complexity. It follows a pragmatic approach to software engineering: providing high-level abstractions where they help, and staying out of the way where they don't.

### Core Principles

* **🧩 Simplicity & Clarity:** Intuitive syntax with minimal verbosity. Code that is easy to read, understand, and maintain over years, not just weeks.
* **🌈 High Expressiveness:** Build powerful programs using modern features like **annotations**, **higher-order functions**, and a **strong yet flexible type system**, all supported by a meticulously organized standard library.
* **⚡ Performance & Agility:** Fast compilation and execution. With a lightweight and efficient runtime, glee is ready for both rapid prototyping and robust production environments.
* **📦 Modularity & Extensibility:** Native support for modules and packages. The ecosystem is designed for growth, featuring built-in support for plugins and a seamless development cycle.
* **🔌 Interoperability & Pragmatism:** glee doesn't live in a silo. It is designed to interoperate with libraries from other languages and run across multiple environments without being tied to a single paradigm.
* **🛠️ Developer-Centric:** A powerful CLI and integrated toolchain (including `loom` and `funx`) ensure that your workflow is smooth from the first line of code to the final deployment.

## 🛠️ The Ecosystem

glee comes with "batteries included" tools to minimize friction:

* **`loom` (WIP)**: The glee package manager.
* **LSP Support (WIP)**: Rich integration with modern IDEs for autocompletion and real-time error checking.
